      <h2>My mental health</h2>
      <p>I feel like something is disappearing in me, like my soul is corrupted. I know I need some help, a little affection. Maybe it’s too much.</p>
      <p>On 12/09/25 I sent “Can we talk?” but got no reply. Anyway, here’s the message I prepared:</p>
      <p>I don’t know what is happening but I feel my mind changing. I’m not the same person anymore. I feel like a corrupted soul waiting to be saved. Every day I carry this bad feeling in my heart.</p>
      <p>Thinking about you makes me cry, but not tears of sadness—something deeper. I am frustrated. On 12/09/25 I took another road because I started crying randomly, and I didn’t want other people to see me like that. I just need some company, some love, a little affection.</p>
      <p>This is not a call for help because I might not get it, and that’s understandable. Just talking, even alone, helps me. Sometimes small gestures, like my mom giving me a kiss on the shoulder, make me cry.</p>
      <p>I know I did horrible things and you might be traumatized by me. I don’t know how to handle this situation. I hope you are happy. I miss you.</p>
      <p>You don’t reply because you can’t, but like every day I’m selfish and only think about myself. Sorry.</p>
      <p>I made a new Twitter account where I tweet random interactions with you that show how my mental health is. I developed some mental issues (nothing serious).</p>

    <!-- Section Sorry -->
    <section id="sorry" class="hidden">
      <h3>Sorry</h3>
      <p>I am sorry. Sometimes I feel I don’t deserve to exist. I sexualized you and did terrible things that I am ashamed to even say.</p>
      <p>You know, karma doesn’t exist. I think life is just math: if you bring misfortune to some people, misfortune comes back to you. I am actually paying for all the misfortune I caused you, and this is hard. I don’t know how you stayed this long in this situation.</p>
      <p>Allah exists; that’s why we are in this situation. I ask you, for the hundredth time, sorry. I can’t do anything else but wait for you to forgive me, and even if you do, I will always apologize.</p>
      <p>I am sorry for everything I did, and for not being a better partner.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section Love -->
    <section id="love" class="hidden">
      <h3>Love</h3>
      <p>I love you.</p>
      <p>When I see you I cry, but at the same time I’m happy. When you text me I cry, but at the same time I am happy. I understand that I can’t live without you and, to be honest, I don’t want to.</p>
      <p>My heart still remembers when you told it that you were better without me; I searched deeply. My heart still remembers all our good memories and it will never forget how special you were to it.</p>
      <p>I don’t know if we are ever going to be like before, I think not, but I will always be here for you if you need help. I love you so much.</p>
      <p>I made this website to empty my heart, and I want you—when you think about me in the future—to remember this website and not all the bad things I did to you, and say deep down “he wasn’t a bad guy.”</p>
      <p>I hope this website makes you happy. I know you are going through a very bad time in your life, I hope it can make you smile again like before, my beloved.</p>
      <p>I built this website alone with a little help from the internet to correct my English and design it. I will continue to add content on the site, so when you have time don’t hesitate to check it.</p>
      <p>You know I still ask God for happiness in your life. I still ask Him to give you and your family paradise. I still ask for our marriage, even though I know that’s not good because you probably don’t want it, and even for my mental health… but if God wills it…</p>
      <p>I check Discord every minute to see if you reply. Not being able to see your reply is even harder. Not knowing what you are doing is hard too. Not being in your life is the hardest. Be happy. If you need help, I am here. Ask help from God and your friends.</p>
