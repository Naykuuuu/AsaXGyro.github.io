      <h2>My mental health</h2>
      <p>I feel like something disappears in me, like my soul is corrupted. I know I need some help, a little affection. Maybe it's too much.</p>
      <p>On 12/09/25 I sent "Can we talk?" but got no reply. Anyway, here's the message I prepared:</p>
      <p>I don’t know what is happening but I feel my mind changing. I’m not the same person anymore. I feel like a corrupted soul waiting to be saved. Every day I stack this bad feeling in my heart.</p>
      <p>Thinking about you makes me cry, but not tears of sadness—something deeper. I am frustrated, I cry in the morning on the street, I just need some company, some love, a little affection.</p>
      <p>That’s not a help call because I might not get it, and that’s understandable. Just talking, even alone, helps me. Sometimes small gestures, like my mom giving me a kiss on the shoulder, make me cry.</p>
      <p>I know I did horrible things and you might be traumatized by me. I don’t know how to handle this situation. I hope you are happy. I miss you.</p>

      <h3>Sorry</h3>
      <p>I am sorry. Sometimes I feel I don’t deserve to exist. I sexualized you and did some terrible things that I am ashamed to even say.</p>
      <p>You know, karma doesn't exist. I think life is just math: if you do misfortune to some people, misfortune comes back to you. I am actually paying for all the misfortune I caused you, and this is hard. I don’t know how you stayed this long in this situation.</p>
      <p>Allah exists; that’s why we are in this situation. I ask you, for the hundredth time, sorry. I can’t do anything else but wait for you to forgive me, and even if you do, I will always apologize.</p>
      <p>I am sorry for all I did, and for not being a better partner.</p>
